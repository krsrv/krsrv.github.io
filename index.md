I graduated from CSE with Honors from IIT Bombay in 2020. I am currently working in Google India as a Software Engineer in Search. During my stay in college, I was affiliated with the CFILT lab, and I finished [my B.Tech. thesis](/docs/BTP.pdf) under [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/). I am interested in NLP and quantum computing.

My hobbies include reading books, playing tennis and flute.
